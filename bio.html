      <p>Bill Dalton was born and raised in New York.</p>

      <p>He received his Bachelor's Degree from Antioch College, where he spent half of the five-year curriculum participating in the College's nationally-renowned field-studies ‘co-op' program. Antioch exposed Bill to the value of work-based education, the Honor-system, and the importance of values-based learning and advocacy. It was there that he embraced his College's edict – “Be ashamed to die until you've won some victory for humanity” – as a guiding principle for his own personal and professional commitments. Bill completed his formal education at Peabody College (Vanderbilt University) in Nashville, focusing his studies in the field of school & community psychology and education.</p>

      <p>After receiving his doctorate, Bill served as a child psychologist in East Tennessee, before moving to Western Kentucky to assume leadership for children's and developmental disabilities services for a seven-county community mental health program. It was there that he made the transition to program and services leadership that led him to Josephine County (Grants Pass), Oregon. During his thirteen years there, he served as the Director of County Mental Health, for eight of those years also guiding the local Public Health Program. During that time, Bill honed his commitment to the development and delivery of responsive, effective, locally-controlled services; became an active participant in the State-County mental health and public health partnerships; and travelled regularly to Salem for service planning and legislative advocacy.</p>

      <p>Following his tenure in southern Oregon, Bill and his family moved to eastern Washington, where he provided leadership for a new four-rural-county mental health consortium, helping facilitate State-County planning for the area east of the Cascades. Six years later the family relocated to Salem, where his wife - a psychiatric nurse practitioner specializing in serving older adults - accepted a position with Oregon State Hospital. During the ensuing years Bill has served as Executive Director of the Oregon Chapter of NAMI (the National Alliance for Mental Illness), director of a local HeadStart Program, and Grant Specialist for the Salem-Keizer Schools. In addition, for over two decades Bill has provided private-practice program assessment and organizational and fund development.</p>

      <p>Bill has taken an active role in each of the communities he has called home. He was a volunteer and then an elected Board member of Oregon's model health needs assessment and approval process (Health Systems Agency), an early member of Oregon Fair Share (community-based issue identification and resolution), and a participant in a wide range of local service programs. His current community/volunteer activities include long-time tenure as a mediator with the Marion County Neighbor-to-Neighbor Program, service as a Board member with the HOME Youth and Resource Center, grant writing for non-profits, member of the Marion County Medical reserve Corps., and active involvement in health, human rights, and advocacy organizations.</p>

      <p>Bill's wife of 40 years, Jeanne, continues work as a psychiatric nurse practitioner. They have two grown children: their daughter Jennifer currently lives in Texas, and their son Andrew in Ohio.</p>
